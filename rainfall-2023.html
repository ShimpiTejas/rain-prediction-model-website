              The blue line in the graph shows the actual rainfall data for
              2023. The green line shows the fitted ARIMA model's prediction of
              the rainfall data. The shaded areas around the green line show the
              model's uncertainty in its predictions. The wider the shaded area,
              the less certain the model is about its prediction. The two
              horizontal red lines show the thresholds used to define heavy
              rainfall and no rainfall events. The ARIMA model was used to
              predict the probability of a heavy rainfall or no rainfall event
              occurring at each time point. These probabilities are shown by the
              gray line in the graph. The higher the gray line, the more likely
              it is that a heavy rainfall event will occur at that time point.
              The x-axis of the graph shows the time in days. The y-axis of the
              graph shows the rainfall in millimeters. The graph shows the data
              for the entire year of 2023.
